Authors' notes: 
This repo includes observational data and analysis codes for a comprehensive survey of the CGM of nearby dwarf galaxies by Zheng et al. (2023). If you use data or codes from this repo, please consider citing the paper (http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12233) and relevant references (Bordoloi+2014, 2018, Liang & Chen 2014, Johnson+2017, Qu & Bregman 2022, Zheng et al. 2019, 2020) used in this paper. 

A few key data files:
data/zheng_dwarfcgm-survey_cut-mstar9.5-snr8-br200m.csv
- based on zheng_dwarfcgm-survey_nocut-in-mstar-snr-b.csv, and apply cut to select only logmstar<=9.5, snr>=8, and b<=R200m
- Note that upper limits are in 1 sigma in this file for both EW and logN, although in analyses we use 3sig

data/zheng_dwarfcgm-survey_nocut-in-mstar-snr-b.csv
- include all new obs/archive search and literature values from B14, B18, LC14, J17, QB22, Z19, Z20, no cuts were applied
